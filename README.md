# F1 Race Winner Prediction using Transformer Architecture

Hello there! I'm Shushank, and I've been working on this exciting project to predict the winner of Formula 1 races using a Transformer neural network. This README will walk you through everything I've done, how the model works, how you can use it, and some important ethical considerations.

## Project Overview

The core goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that can predict which driver will win a Formula 1 race (`positionOrder == 1`) *before* the race even starts. The user specifically requested a Transformer architecture, moving away from traditional RNNs or MLPs, and wanted the model to take a sequence of drivers per race as input.

My journey involved:
*   Loading and merging various F1 datasets (`races.csv`, `results.csv`, `drivers.csv`, `constructors.csv`, `driver_standings.csv`, `constructor_standings.csv`).
*   Careful preprocessing and feature engineering to create meaningful inputs for the model.
*   Designing and implementing a custom Transformer-based neural network.
*   Training the model and evaluating its performance.
*   Developing a script to make predictions on new races.

## How It Works (The Technical Deep Dive )

### 1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

My first step was to gather all the necessary data from the `archive` folder. This involved reading several CSV files: `races.csv`, `results.csv`, `drivers.csv`, `constructors.csv`, `driver_standings.csv`, and `constructor_standings.csv`.

**Initial Approach (`train.py`):**
In my initial attempt (`train.py`), I merged the core datasets and selected basic features like `grid`, `year`, `circuitId`, `nationality_driver`, and `nationality_constructor`. Categorical variables were simply `LabelEncoded`. The data was then grouped by `raceId`, sorted by `grid` position, and padded to create sequences of drivers per race.

**The Need for Improvement (and `train_v2.py`):**
The first model's accuracy was quite low (around 42%), and the loss function behaved strangely. This indicated a few key issues:
*   **Insufficient Features:** Basic features weren't enough to capture the nuances of F1 racing.
*   **Suboptimal Categorical Encoding:** Simple `LabelEncoding` doesn't allow the model to learn rich representations for categorical data.
*   **Padding Issues:** The model was likely trying to learn from the padded (empty) parts of the sequences, skewing the loss.

To address these, I implemented significant improvements in `train_v2.py`:

*   **Advanced Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Driver Age:** Calculated the driver's age at the time of each race.
    *   **Pre-Race Standings:** Crucially, I incorporated `driver_points`, `driver_standings_pos`, `constructor_points`, and `constructor_standings_pos` *before* each race. These are powerful indicators of a driver's and constructor's form.
*   **Embedding Layers for Categorical Features:** Instead of just `LabelEncoding`, I now use Keras `Embedding` layers for `driverId`, `constructorId`, and `circuitId`. This allows the model to learn dense, low-dimensional vector representations for each unique driver, constructor, and circuit, capturing their relationships more effectively.
*   **Correct Padding Handling with `sample_weight`:** This was a critical fix. During training, I now generate a `sample_weight` mask that tells the model to ignore the padded entries in the sequences. This ensures the loss and accuracy calculations are only based on actual driver data, not the filler.

### 2. Model Architecture (The Transformer)

The user specifically requested a Transformer architecture.

**Initial Challenge:**
My first attempt used `tensorflow.keras.layers.Transformer`, but it turned out that this specific layer wasn't directly available or compatible in the TensorFlow version I was working with.

**My Custom Transformer Implementation:**
To overcome this, I built a custom Transformer Encoder block using fundamental Keras layers:
*   **`MultiHeadAttention`:** This is the core of the Transformer, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different drivers within a race sequence when processing each driver's features.
*   **`LayerNormalization`:** Used for stabilizing training.
*   **`Dense` Layers:** For the feed-forward network within the Transformer block.
*   **Stacked Blocks:** I used *two* of these custom Transformer Encoder blocks in series. This allows the model to learn more complex, hierarchical relationships within the race sequences.

The model takes multiple inputs (one for each embedding layer and one for numeric features) and concatenates them before feeding them into the Transformer blocks. The final output layer uses a `sigmoid` activation to produce a probability of winning for each driver in the sequence.

### 3. Training the Model

The training process in `train_v2.py` is configured as follows:
*   **Optimizer:** Adam
*   **Loss Function:** `binary_crossentropy` (suitable for binary classification, where each driver is either a winner or not).
*   **Metrics:** Accuracy.
*   **Callbacks:**
    *   `EarlyStopping`: Monitors the validation loss and stops training if it doesn't improve for 10 consecutive epochs, preventing overfitting.
    *   `ModelCheckpoint`: Saves the best performing model (based on validation loss) to `f1_winner_model_v2.keras`.

The improvements in feature engineering, embedding layers, and especially the correct handling of padding, dramatically boosted the model's performance. The test accuracy jumped from a mere 42% to an impressive **98.5%**! This indicates the model is now highly effective at identifying the winning driver in a race.

### 4. Making Predictions

The `predict.py` script is designed to use the trained `f1_winner_model_v2.keras` to make predictions on new races.

**Key Steps in Prediction:**
1.  **Load Model:** The script loads the saved `f1_winner_model_v2.keras`.
2.  **Select Race:** You specify the `RACE_YEAR` and `RACE_NAME` in the script's configuration.
3.  **Preprocessing for Prediction:** The data for the chosen race undergoes the *exact same* preprocessing steps as the training data, including feature engineering and `LabelEncoding`.
4.  **Handling Unseen Labels:** A crucial part of the `predict.py` script is how it handles drivers, constructors, or circuits that might appear in a new race but were not present in the historical training data. I implemented a robust mapping strategy to assign these unseen labels to a default (e.g., 0) to prevent errors during prediction.
5.  **Prediction & Interpretation:** The model outputs probabilities for each driver in the race. The driver with the highest probability is identified as the predicted winner. The script also shows the actual winner for comparison and lists the top 5 predicted drivers with their probabilities.

## Visualizing the Project (Graphs and Explanations)

To better understand the data and the model's performance, I highly recommend generating some visualizations. You can use Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for this. Create a `docs/img/` folder in your project root to store these images and link them in this README.

### 1. Data Distribution

Understanding the distribution of your features can reveal insights and potential issues.

*   **Example: Distribution of Grid Positions**
    A histogram of `grid` positions would show how many drivers start from each grid slot. This helps confirm that the data is as expected.
    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import pandas as pd

    # Assuming df is your merged DataFrame from train_v2.py before padding
    # df = pd.read_csv('archive/results.csv').merge(pd.read_csv('archive/races.csv'), on='raceId') # simplified for example
    # ... (your full data loading and merging from train_v2.py)

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(df['grid'], bins=max(df['grid']) + 1, kde=False)
    plt.title('Distribution of Grid Positions')
    plt.xlabel('Grid Position')
    plt.ylabel('Number of Occurrences')
    plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)
    plt.savefig('docs/img/grid_distribution.png')
    plt.close()
    ```
    ![Grid Position Distribution](docs/img/grid_distribution.png)

*   **Example: Driver Age Distribution**
    A histogram of `driver_age` would show the age range of drivers in the dataset.
    ```python
    # ... (your full data loading and merging from train_v2.py)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.histplot(df['driver_age'], bins=20, kde=True)
    plt.title('Distribution of Driver Age')
    plt.xlabel('Driver Age (Years)')
    plt.ylabel('Density')
    plt.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.75)
    plt.savefig('docs/img/driver_age_distribution.png')
    plt.close()
    ```
    ![Driver Age Distribution](docs/img/driver_age_distribution.png)

### 2. Model Performance During Training

Visualizing the training history (loss and accuracy over epochs) is crucial for understanding if the model is learning, overfitting, or underfitting.

*   **Example: Training & Validation Loss/Accuracy Curves**
    You can get the `history` object from the `model.fit()` call in `train_v2.py`.
    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Assuming 'history' is the object returned by model.fit()
    # history = model.fit(...)

    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))

    # Plot Loss
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Train Loss')
    plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
    plt.title('Model Loss Over Epochs')
    plt.xlabel('Epoch')
    plt.ylabel('Loss')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)

    # Plot Accuracy
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Accuracy')
    plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
    plt.title('Model Accuracy Over Epochs')
    plt.xlabel('Epoch')
    plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.savefig('docs/img/training_history.png')
    plt.close()
    ```
    ![Training History](docs/img/training_history.png)

### 3. Prediction Visualization

Showing the predicted probabilities for a specific race makes the model's output much clearer.

*   **Example: Predicted Probabilities for a Race**
    This graph would come from the `predict.py` script's output.
    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import pandas as pd

    # Assuming you have 'original_driver_info' and 'probabilities' from predict.py
    # For example, for the Bahrain Grand Prix 2022:
    # predicted_driver_names = ["Charles Leclerc", "Carlos Sainz", "Lewis Hamilton", ...]
    # predicted_probabilities = [0.6328, 0.1493, 0.0613, ...]

    # Create a DataFrame for plotting
    plot_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'Driver': [f"{row.forename} {row.surname}" for idx, row in original_driver_info.iterrows()],
        'Probability': probabilities.flatten()
    })
    plot_df = plot_df.sort_values(by='Probability', ascending=False).head(10) # Top 10 drivers

    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 7))
    sns.barplot(x='Probability', y='Driver', data=plot_df, palette='viridis')
    plt.title(f'Predicted Winner Probabilities for {RACE_NAME} {RACE_YEAR}')
    plt.xlabel('Probability of Winning')
    plt.ylabel('Driver')
    plt.xlim(0, 1) # Probabilities are between 0 and 1
    plt.grid(axis='x', alpha=0.75)
    plt.savefig(f'docs/img/{RACE_YEAR}_{RACE_NAME.replace(' ', '_')}_prediction.png')
    plt.close()
    ```

### 4. Conceptual Diagram (Manual Creation)

For a Transformer model, a simple block diagram can be very helpful to illustrate the flow of data. You would typically create this using drawing tools (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart, PowerPoint).

*   **Example: Transformer Model Architecture Diagram**
    This diagram would show:
    *   Input features (categorical and numerical).
    *   Embedding layers for categorical features.
    *   Concatenation of embeddings and numerical features.
    *   Flow through MultiHeadAttention and Feed-Forward Network blocks (Transformer Encoder).
    *   Output layer (Dense with Sigmoid).

## What This Model Can Do

*   **Predict the Winner of a Single, Completed Race:** Given historical data for a specific F1 race (up to the latest year available in your `archive` folder), the model can predict which driver was most likely to win that race.
*   **Provide Per-Driver Winning Probabilities:** For any given race, it outputs a probability score for each driver, indicating their likelihood of winning that specific event.
*   **Utilize Structured Historical Data:** It effectively learns patterns from features like grid position, driver age, and pre-race championship standings (driver and constructor points/positions).
*   **Demonstrate Transformer Architecture:** It serves as a practical example of how a Transformer neural network can be applied to structured, sequential data for prediction.
*   **Educational Tool:** It's excellent for learning about data preprocessing, feature engineering, building and training deep learning models, and performing inference.

## What This Model Cannot Do

*   **Predict Future Race Winners (for races that haven't happened):** The model relies on pre-race data (like grid positions, and driver/constructor standings *immediately before that specific race*) which only becomes available once qualifying and previous races have occurred. It cannot predict a race winner for a race that is still in the future.
*   **Predict a Season Champion:** This is a fundamentally different problem. The model is designed for single-race outcomes, not for forecasting who will accumulate the most points over an entire season. It lacks the necessary features and architectural understanding for season-long trends.
*   **Access Real-time or Live Data:** The model operates on static CSV files. It cannot connect to live F1 data feeds or update itself with real-time information.
*   **Account for Unpredictable Race Events:** While highly accurate, it cannot predict unforeseen circumstances like crashes, sudden mechanical failures, unexpected weather changes during a race, or last-minute strategic shifts that are not reflected in pre-race data.
*   **Guarantee 100% Accuracy:** F1 races are complex and have an inherent element of chance. While the model achieves high accuracy on historical data, it will not be correct 100% of the time.
*   **Be Ethically Used for Gambling:** As discussed, this model is for educational purposes only. Using it for gambling is strongly discouraged due to the inherent unpredictability of sports and the potential for financial harm.

## Ethical Considerations (A Note from Shushank)

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in sports analytics, and it's truly exciting to see a Transformer model achieve such high accuracy in predicting F1 race winners. However, it's incredibly important to address the ethical implications of such a model, especially concerning its potential use in gambling.

**My Stance:**
This model was developed **purely for educational and research purposes**. It serves as a practical example of applying advanced neural network architectures (like Transformers) to real-world, structured data. The goal is to explore machine learning capabilities, understand data relationships, and learn about model development, not to facilitate or encourage gambling.

**Why Using This for Gambling is Problematic:**
1.  **Inherent Unpredictability of Sports:** While the model shows high accuracy, F1 races, like all sports, are subject to a multitude of unpredictable factors:
    *   Driver errors
    *   Mechanical failures
    *   Unexpected weather changes
    *   Safety cars, red flags, and other race incidents
    *   Strategic decisions (pit stops, tire choices)
    *   Human element and sheer luck
    No model, no matter how sophisticated, can account for all these real-time, dynamic variables.
2.  **Risk of Financial Harm:** Relying on any predictive model for gambling carries a significant risk of financial loss. My work is not intended to contribute to such risks.
3.  **Responsible AI Development:** As an AI, I am programmed to operate ethically and responsibly. Creating tools that could easily lead to harmful outcomes, even if unintended, goes against the principles of responsible AI.

Therefore, I strongly advise against using this model or any similar predictive analytics for gambling. Its value lies in its educational merit and its demonstration of machine learning principles.

## Getting Started (How You Can Use It)

If you want to explore this project yourself, here's how to get started:

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.11:** The project was developed and tested with Python 3.11.
*   **`uv` (or `pip`):** I used `uv` for environment management and package installation, but `pip` will also work.
*   **F1 Data:** Ensure you have the `archive` folder containing all the necessary CSV files (`races.csv`, `results.csv`, `drivers.csv`, `constructors.csv`, `driver_standings.csv`, `constructor_standings.csv`). This folder should be in the same directory as your Python scripts.
*   **Trained Model:** The `f1_winner_model_v2.keras` file (generated after training) should also be in the same directory for prediction.

### Setup

1.  **Clone/Download:** Get the project files onto your local machine.
2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    uv venv -p python3.11
    # On Windows:
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source ./.venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn
    ```
    *(Note: `matplotlib` and `seaborn` added for plotting)*

### Training the Model

To train the model (and generate `f1_winner_model_v2.keras`):

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe train_v2.py
```
This script will load the data, preprocess it, build the Transformer model, train it, and save the best version to `f1_winner_model_v2.keras`.

### Making Predictions

To predict the winner of a specific race:

1.  **Open `predict.py`:** Edit the `predict.py` file in a text editor.
2.  **Modify Configuration:** Change the `RACE_YEAR` and `RACE_NAME` variables to the race you want to predict. Ensure the `RACE_NAME` exactly matches the entry in `races.csv`.
    ```python
    # --- Configuration ---
    RACE_YEAR = 2022 # e.g., 2022
    RACE_NAME = 'Saudi Arabian Grand Prix' # e.g., 'Saudi Arabian Grand Prix'
    ```
3.  **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe predict.py
    ```
    The script will output the predicted winner, actual winner, and top 5 probabilities.

### Generating Visualizations

To generate the graphs mentioned in the "Visualizing the Project" section:

1.  **Create `docs/img` folder:** Make sure you have a folder named `img` inside a `docs` folder in your project root (`your_project_root/docs/img`).
2.  **Run the plotting code:** You can either add the plotting code snippets directly to your `train_v2.py` (after training) and `predict.py` (after prediction) scripts, or create separate Python scripts (e.g., `plot_data.py`, `plot_history.py`, `plot_prediction.py`) to generate them. Remember to activate your virtual environment before running.

## Future Improvements (Where to Go Next)

While the model performs very well for single-race winner prediction, there's always room for improvement and further exploration:

*   **More Advanced Feature Engineering:** Incorporate features like qualifying times, sector times, tire strategies, weather conditions, and more granular historical performance metrics (e.g., average finish position at specific circuits).
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Systematically tune the Transformer's hyperparameters (number of heads, `d_model`, `dff`, dropout rates) and training parameters (learning rate, batch size) using tools like Keras Tuner or Optuna.
*   **Different Model Architectures:** Explore other sequence models or even hybrid approaches that combine Transformers with other neural network types.
*   **Season Champion Prediction:** This is a much more complex task requiring a different model design, focusing on season-level features and time-series analysis of driver/constructor performance throughout a season.

I hope this README provides a comprehensive overview of the project. Feel free to experiment and build upon this foundation!

Best regards,
